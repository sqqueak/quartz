## about
I'm a [student](/uw-madison-course-review) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying computer science and mathematics. My interests broadly cover low-level systems, particularly programming languages and compilers, but in the past I've also enjoyed studying computer networks and operating systems.

I've have the wonderful privilege of working in a handful of different roles across various institutions, including:
- **Two Sigma**, incoming 
- **Cisco** (Consulting)
- **Morgridge Institute of Research** (Infrastructure tools)
- **Mandli Communications** (Application development)
- **madPL** (Zero-knowledge proofs, choreographies)
- **UW CONNECT Lab** (Data visualization) 

Outside of school/work, my main hobby is puzzle-solving. I like [coding games](https://battlecode.org/), [logic puzzles](https://www.brainbashers.com/), and whatever [these](https://cdn.cs50.net/2020/x/events/puzzles/puzzles.pdf) are called. 

<!-- I also like to [read](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books) and walk around outside. -->

<!-- Welcome to my pothole on the Internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" -- from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm an undergraduate [student](/uw-madison-course-review) at UW-Madison studying computer science, mathematics, and economics.  -->

<!-- Currently, I'm:  
&nbsp; \- working on data analysis tools as a part of the UW CONNECT Lab  
&nbsp; \- developing automation scripts at the [Center for High-Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/)  
&nbsp; \- level 32 in pokemon go -->

<!-- My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from -- I particularly enjoy competitive programming and coding [games](/projects#contests), such as [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). My main areas of interest in computer science are in low-level systems like compilers and programming languages, among other topics such as computer networks, optimization, and data visualization. In terms of math, I'm primarily interested in combinatorics.  -->

<!-- In my free time, I like [reading](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books), playing poker, and listening to [video game music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE). 

I also occasionally delve into math-related projects and visualizations as a means to create my own mathematics teaching style. -->

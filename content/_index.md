I am a [student](/uw-madison-course-review) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying computer science and mathematics. I'm mainly interested in programming languages and compilers, among other low-level topics like operating systems and computer networks. I'm currently part of the [madPL](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu/) group, advised by [Ethan Cecchetti](https://cecchetti.sites.cs.wisc.edu/).

Most recently, I was at Two Sigma as a software engineering intern. I worked in the Securities division on the Routing & Execution team and wrote a [technical blog](/manifests-for-protocol-compatibility) about my internship project.

I've had the wonderful privilege of working in a handful of different roles across various institutions, including:
- **Two Sigma** (Compiler development)
- **madPL** (Zero-knowledge proofs, choreographies)
- **Cisco** (Consulting)
- **Center for High-Throughput Computing** (Infrastructure tools)
- **Mandli Communications** (Application development)
- **UW CONNECT Lab** (Data visualization) 

Outside of school/work, my main hobby is puzzle-solving. I like [coding games](https://battlecode.org/), [logic puzzles](https://www.brainbashers.com/), and whatever [these](https://cdn.cs50.net/2020/x/events/puzzles/puzzles.pdf) are called.

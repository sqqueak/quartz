title: UW-Madison Course Reviews
enableToc: true
---

This is a comprehensive list of every single class I've taken at UW-Madison. I intend for this post to give people an insight into how I balanced coursework with part-time work and extracurriculars as an undergraduate student. Each semester has a star rating assigned to it which corresponds with how difficult the semester was -- more stars imply greater difficulty. 

I've denoted part-time work or internships I held during the semester as ðŸ’¼ and research related projects as ðŸ”¬. I've also noted courses that I particularly enjoyed as (^), courses that were particularly time consuming as (!), and courses that I largely disliked as (.).
